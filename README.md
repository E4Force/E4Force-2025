# E4FORCE
This is a team that competes in the future engineers category with the mission of creating a autonomous car, competitive and original. The members of this team are Efrain Ortiz Mulero, Elian Flores Medina both students highlighted by there integration in the pre engineering workshop (electronics) in the Benjamin Harrison high school of Cayey and Edianid Gonz√°lez Morales that recentely graduated from the same high school (in the present studying in UPR university). Are autonomous car integrates color sensors and proximity sensors to detect obstacles in its way. It uses micro python as a software to interpret the data and Cythron maker pi rp2040 pro as a hardware to execute instructions and manage the motors. We use a rechargeable battery as an energy source and a cable that requires the voltage to 9V.

## Our Goal
- [] ~~four wheel drive~~
- [] ~~front wheel drive~~
- [x] rear wheel drive
- [x] [color library](/src/color.py)
- [x] [motors library](/src/motors.py)
- [x] [servo library](/src/servo.py)
- [x] better documentation (better then last years documentation)
- [x] team pictures
- [x] [robot pictures](/v-photos/V1_car)
- [x] redisign robot
- [x] completly original mechanics

## Things we changed
- We changed the board (MOTION 2350 PRO) to an older one (Maker Pi 2040) since the one we were using had an error which affected a lot of the processes of programming because if we frequently uploaded a new code to the board, it would crash and everything would get corrupted. Sometimes we even needed to reinstall the microphyton firmware. This was so often that in the WRO Open Championship in October 2024 we had to stop updating the code at least 10 minutes before each round because it was too risky.
- We started the design of our new car using Autodesk Fusion a 3d designing app for mechanical engineering.
